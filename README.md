# Project Overview

## Project Name

need-a-drink

## Project Description

This app will be used to help users find breweries in the area. I will include at least 3 buttons to allow the user to search by name, by state, and by zip code. Each search will return 20 results per page that include the address, phone number, and website of each result. This is intended to make communication with the brewies easily accessible for the user. Additionally, search results will be deleted when a new input is added to the search bar. In order to allow the user to keep track of interesting brewies before a new search, post MVP I will add storage for a favorite/bookmark option.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This **must** be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "recONRzIUTuZ5lXaF",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Liz Yrineo",
        "setup": "Why did the tomato turn red?",
        "punchline": "Because it saw the salad dressing!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "rec3oYZ5Tp0AIDsKe",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Rachel Moskowitz",
        "setup": "What did the green grape say to the red grape?",
        "punchline": "Breathe, idiot, breathe!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1",
      "fields": {
        "author": "Gary Grant",
        "setup": "How do you make holy water?",
        "punchline": "You boil the hell out of it!"
      },
      "createdTime": "2020-11-30T16:03:09.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "offset": "recA34tOaoE1IVeC1"
}
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP. Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- Use open brewery api with react
- home page with at least three search options/buttons
- render data pulled onto page
- delete previous searches

#### PostMVP

- Create storage
- Allow bookmarks/favorites for user

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations. Here's an example.

| Day          | Deliverable                                        | Status     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| December 1st | Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete |
| December 2nd | Project Approval                                   | Incomplete |
| December 3rd | Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.)       | Incomplete |
| December 6th | Pseudocode / actual code                           | Incomplete |
| December 7th | Initial Clickable Model                            | Incomplete |
| December 8th | MVP                                                | Incomplete |
| December 9th | Presentations                                      | Incomplete |

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all parts of your app. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component        | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I understand what my app needs to look like. If I plan everything out step by step it will allow me to complete the project on time

### Weaknesses:

Understanding functionality with Airtable is definitely my weakness as it is one of the newer materials learned. I will need to spend a bulk of more time incorporating this with my API

### Opportunities:

This project gives me an opportunity to catch up on material from the last two weeks and showcase my knowledge of it to my peers.

### Threats:

I can become unmotivated when I cannot solve an issue within a few hours. I like to plan out my project step by step and at times it feels that if I cannot figure out what I am working on currently it discourages me from solving my next problem. I need to understand that confusion is part of the process and reach out to my instructors when help is required.
